# Weather-app

This is a web app that displays the temperature, city, description, and other weather variables for a given location. To obtain this data, I use an API called [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). The objective is to demonstrate the ability to use React and consume APIs using this technology.

Features:

- Functional components and state hooks
- Consumption of 2 APIs
- Error handling and state management
- Componentization and reusability

To run the program, you need to generate your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Follow these steps:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Navigate to the Pricing section.
3. Click on "Get API key" in the Free section.

To run the application, execute the following commands:

```javascript
npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
npm i dotenv
npm i react
npm i react-dom
npm i react-router-dom
```

## to execute

```javascript
npm run build
```
